  <h2>Writing Hello World Program</h2>
  <p class="Getting-started">Good Going, Now that you have installed python we can proceed to the next step, let's write
    Hello World Program. For Python.
    first search for the <b>IDLE</b> by pressing windows key , and open it (this is for windows users). For other OS
    users you can use console and search for the <b>IDLE</b>.
    <br><img src="./../image/program1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="program1"><br>
    Now after opening it you should see something like this:
    <br><img src="./../image/program2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="program2"><br>
    Now click on the File Icon and select the <b>New File</b> option you will be getting a blank editor. Great!
    Now let's write our first program in Python. Before that few things to keep in mind are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>In Python we don't use semicolons</li>
      <li>Here there's no concept of Curly Braces to show the end and start scope of any particular function</li>
      <li>Python Follows Identation Rules , thus you need to take care of Identation in Python</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Alright!, that's enough for now let's make this interesting and write our program<br>
    <img src="./../image/program3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="helloworld">
    Save the above file and run it you should see Hello World as the output. Pretty simple right :P , Python is the language with which you will have lot's of fun and it's easy to learn and understand too. 
    Now let's try to understand our code , in the above example I have used <b>Print</b> function of python. Which Basically gives the output, the syntax is <b>print( *Whatever You Want to Print*)</b>
